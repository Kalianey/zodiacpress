ZodiacPress
===========

ZodiacPress lets you generate astrology birth reports with your custom interpretations in WordPress.

For regular use, download the plugin [from WordPress](https://wordpress.org/plugins/zodiacpress/) since the version here on GitHub is a development version.

See the [documentation](https://cosmicplugins.com/docs/category/zodiacpress/ "ZodiacPress Documentation").
